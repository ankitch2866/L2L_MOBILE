  - `checkCustomerUnit` - Verify customer has allotted unit
  - `checkTransferCharge` - Check if customer has pending transfer charge
  - `markTransferChargeUsed` - Mark transfer charge as used
  - `fetchUnitOwners` - Get ownership history for a unit
  - `updateTransfer` - Update transfer details

**State Structure**:
```javascript
{
  list: [],
  current: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  customerUnit: null,
  transferChargeStatus: null,
  unitOwners: [],
}
```

- Cheque payment details (cheque number, bank, date)
- Real-time validation
- Customer unit allotment check

#### c. UnitTransferDetailsScreen.js
- Comprehensive transfer information display
- Transaction details (ID, amount, date, mode, verification status)

- Unit information (name, project, size, price)
- New owner information
- Transfer charge details
- Payment details (online or cheque)

#### d. EditUnitTransferScreen.js

- Mark transfer charge as used
- Transfer process workflow guidance

### 3. Navigation Integration ✅
**File**: `src/navigation/DashboardNavigator.js`

**Changes**:
- Added import for unit transfer screens
- Created `UnitTransfersStack` navigator
- Added stack to root navigator with card presentation
- Configured header styling consistent with app theme

**Navigation Routes**:
- `UnitTransfersList` - Main list screen
- `CreateUnitTransfer` - Create new transfer
- `UnitTransferDetails` - View transfer details
- `EditUnitTransfer` - Edit transfer
- `TransferTransaction` - Transfer transaction workflow

### 4. Store Integration ✅
**File**: `src/store/index.js`

- Added `unitTransfersReducer` to Redux store
- Configured with serializable check disabled for date handling

## API Endpoints Used

2. `POST /api/transaction/unit-transfer/record` - Record transfer charge
3. `GET /api/transaction/unit-transfer/transaction/:id` - Get transfer details
4. `GET /api/transaction/unit-transfer/check-customer/:id` - Check customer unit
5. `GET /api/transaction/unit-transfer/check-transfer-charge/:id` - Check transfer charge
6. `PATCH /api/transaction/unit-transfer/mark-used/:id` - Mark charge as used
7. `GET /api/transaction/unit-transfer/owners/:unitId` - Get unit owners
