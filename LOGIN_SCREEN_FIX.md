# Login Screen Dark Mode Fix

## Problem
When dark mode was enabled in the app, it affected the login screen text too, making it hard to read. The login screen should always use light mode regardless of the app's dark mode setting.

## Solution
Wrapped the LoginScreen with its own PaperProvider that always uses `lightTheme`, overriding the app-level theme.

## Changes Made

### Updated LoginScreen.js

**Added Import:**
```javascript
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';
import { lightTheme } from '../../config/theme';
```

**Wrapped Component:**
```javascript
return (
  <PaperProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    <KeyboardAvoidingView>
      {/* Login screen content */}
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  </PaperProvider>
);
```

## How It Works

### Theme Hierarchy
```
App Level (Dynamic Theme)
  └── ThemedApp (switches between light/dark)
      └── PaperProvider (light or dark theme)
          └── Dashboard Screens (use app theme)
          
Login Screen (Always Light)
  └── PaperProvider (always lightTheme)
      └── Login Form (always light mode)
```

### Why This Works
- Each PaperProvider creates its own theme context
- Inner PaperProvider overrides outer PaperProvider
- Login screen's PaperProvider always provides lightTheme
- Dashboard screens use the app-level PaperProvider (dynamic theme)

## Result

### ✅ Login Screen Behavior
- **Always uses light mode** regardless of app setting
- White background
- Dark text (readable)
- Red accent colors
- Proper contrast

### ✅ Dashboard Behavior
- **Respects dark mode setting**
- Switches between light and dark
- All text visible in both modes

## Testing

### Test Login Screen in Light Mode
1. Open app (not logged in)
2. ✅ Login screen shows with light theme
3. ✅ Text is dark and readable
4. ✅ Background is white

### Test Login Screen in Dark Mode
1. Login to app
2. Go to Profile → Settings
3. Enable Dark Mode
4. ✅ Dashboard turns dark
5. Logout
6. ✅ Login screen still shows light theme
7. ✅ Text is still dark and readable
8. ✅ Background is still white

### Test Dashboard After Login
1. From login screen (light mode)
2. Login
3. ✅ Dashboard respects dark mode setting
4. If dark mode was ON → Dashboard is dark
5. If dark mode was OFF → Dashboard is light

## Files Modified

1. `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.js`
   - Added PaperProvider wrapper
   - Always uses lightTheme
   - Overrides app-level theme

## Technical Details

### PaperProvider Nesting
React Native Paper supports nested providers. The innermost provider takes precedence for its children. This allows us to:
- Have app-level theme (dynamic)
- Override theme for specific screens (login)
- Keep other screens using app theme

### Theme Isolation
```javascript
// App Level - Dynamic
<PaperProvider theme={isDarkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme}>
  <Dashboard /> {/* Uses app theme */}
</PaperProvider>

// Login Screen - Always Light
<PaperProvider theme={lightTheme}>
  <LoginForm /> {/* Always uses light theme */}
</PaperProvider>
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Login screen always readable
2. **Consistent**: Login always looks the same
3. **Professional**: No theme confusion on login
4. **Isolated**: Login theme doesn't affect app
5. **Simple**: One-line wrapper solution

## Status

✅ **Login screen now always uses light mode**
✅ **Text always readable on login screen**
✅ **Dark mode only affects authenticated screens**
✅ **No impact on existing functionality**
