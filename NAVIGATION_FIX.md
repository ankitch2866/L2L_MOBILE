# Navigation Fix - Profile Screens Now Working

## Problem
Profile section had three options (Reset Password, Settings, About) but clicking them did nothing because the screens weren't connected to the navigation.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated DashboardNavigator.js
Created a Profile Stack Navigator to handle profile sub-screens:

```javascript
// Profile Stack Navigator
const ProfileStack = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen name="ProfileMain" component={ProfileScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="ResetPassword" component={ResetPasswordScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="About" component={AboutScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
};
```

### 2. Added ThemeProvider to App.js
Wrapped the app with ThemeProvider to enable dark mode functionality:

```javascript
<ThemeProvider>
  <PaperProvider theme={lightTheme}>
    {/* Rest of app */}
  </PaperProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

### 3. Removed Old ProfileScreen
Deleted the old `src/screens/dashboard/ProfileScreen.js` that was conflicting.
