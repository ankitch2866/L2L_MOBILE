# Properties Module Fix - Mobile Frontend

## Problem
The properties section in the mobile frontend was not working at all - not showing any cards of available properties, and the functionality didn't match the web frontend.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Wrong API Endpoints
**Problem**: The mobile app was using incorrect API endpoints
- Used: `/master/properties` (doesn't exist)
- Should use: `/master/project/:projectId/units` (correct backend endpoint)

### 2. Wrong Data Structure
**Problem**: The Redux slice expected a flat array of properties
- Backend returns properties grouped by project
- Need to fetch projects first, then units for each project
- Web frontend does this correctly

### 3. Missing Project Context
**Problem**: Properties (units) are always associated with projects
- Mobile app didn't fetch projects first
- Couldn't display properties grouped by project
- No way to filter by project

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Redux Slice (`propertiesSlice.js`)

**New State Structure**:
```javascript
{
  projects: [],           // Array of all projects
  projectUnits: {},       // Object mapping project_id to units array
  currentProperty: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  searchQuery: '',
  selectedProject: '',    // For filtering
}
```

**New Actions**:
- `fetchAllPropertiesData()` - Fetches projects, then units for each project in parallel
- `fetchPropertiesByProject(projectId)` - Fetches units for specific project
- `createProperty()` - Uses `/master/unit` endpoint
- `updateProperty()` - Uses `/master/unit/:id` endpoint
- `deleteProperty()` - Uses `/master/unit/:id` endpoint
- `fetchPropertyById()` - Uses `/master/unit/:id` endpoint

**Key Changes**:
- Correct API endpoints matching backend routes
- Proper error handling with success checks
- Parallel fetching of units for better performance
- Maintains project-unit relationship

### 2. Completely Rewrote PropertiesListScreen

**New Features Matching Web Frontend**:

1. **Project-Based Display**:
   - Properties grouped by project
   - Shows project name as section header
   - Shows count of properties per project

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search by project name
   - Search by unit name
   - Search by unit type
   - Real-time filtering

3. **Project Filter**:
   - Dropdown menu to filter by specific project
   - "All Projects" option
   - Shows filtered state in button

4. **Property Cards**:
   - Unit name with status badge
   - Color-coded status (Available/Booked/Sold/Reserved)
   - Type, Floor, Size, Price details
   - View and Edit action buttons

5. **Status Colors**:
   - Available/Free: Green (#10B981)
   - Booked: Blue (#3B82F6)
   - Sold: Red (#EF4444)
   - Reserved: Yellow (#F59E0B)

6. **Formatting**:
   - Currency formatted as ₹ (Indian Rupees)
   - Unit size formatted with "sq ft"
   - Proper number formatting with commas

7. **Auto-Refresh**:
   - Uses `useFocusEffect` to refresh when screen comes into focus
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Manual refresh button

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Shows error messages
   - Retry button
   - Graceful fallbacks

9. **Empty States**:
   - Different messages for no data vs no search results
   - Action button to add first property

## API Endpoints Used

### Backend Routes (from `masterRoutes.js`):
```javascript
POST   /api/master/unit                    // Create unit
PUT    /api/master/unit/:id                // Update unit
GET    /api/master/units                   // Get all units
GET    /api/master/unit/:id                // Get unit by ID
DELETE /api/master/unit/:id                // Delete unit
GET    /api/master/project/:projectId/units // Get units by project
GET    /api/master/projects                // Get all projects
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/store/slices/propertiesSlice.js`
- Complete rewrite of Redux slice
- New state structure with projects and projectUnits
- Fixed all API endpoints
- Added proper error handling
- Added parallel fetching for performance

### 2. `src/screens/properties/PropertiesListScreen.js`
- Complete rewrite to match web frontend
- Project-based grouping
- Enhanced search and filtering
- Better UI with status colors
- Auto-refresh on focus
- Proper formatting

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Properties load correctly grouped by project
- [x] Search works for project name, unit name, and type
- [x] Filter by project works
- [x] Status badges show correct colors
- [x] Currency and size formatting works
- [x] View button navigates to details
- [x] Edit button navigates to edit screen
- [x] Add button navigates to add screen
- [x] Pull-to-refresh works
- [x] Auto-refresh on focus works
- [x] Empty state shows when no properties
- [x] Error handling works
- [ ] Create property works (needs testing)

## Known Limitations

1. **Add/Edit Screens Not Updated Yet**:
   - These screens may still have old logic
   - Need to be updated to use correct endpoints
   - Will be addressed in next phase

2. **Property Details Screen**:
   - May need updates to match new data structure
   - Should be tested and updated if needed

3. **No Image Support Yet**:
   - Properties don't have images in current implementation
   - Can be added later if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Update AddPropertyScreen**:
   - Use correct `/master/unit` endpoint
   - Ensure proper project selection
   - Test creation flow

2. **Update EditPropertyScreen**:
   - Use correct `/master/unit/:id` endpoint
   - Implement auto-refresh like projects module
   - Test update flow

3. **Update PropertyDetailsScreen**:
   - Ensure it displays all unit fields correctly
   - Add status badge
   - Test navigation flow

4. **Add Book/Free Functionality**:
   - Web frontend has booking functionality
   - Need to implement in mobile
   - Requires backend integration

## Performance Improvements

1. **Parallel Fetching**:
   - Fetches units for all projects simultaneously
   - Much faster than sequential fetching
   - Uses `Promise.all()`

2. **Memoized Filtering**:
   - Uses `useMemo` for filtered data
   - Only recalculates when dependencies change
   - Improves scroll performance

3. **Focus-Based Refresh**:
   - Only refreshes when screen is focused
   - Avoids unnecessary API calls
   - Better user experience
