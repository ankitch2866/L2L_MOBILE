# ‚úÖ Login Issue Fixed!

## Problem
Login was failing because the app was trying to connect to `localhost`, which doesn't work on mobile devices.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Found Your IP Address
Your computer's IP: **192.168.1.27**

### 2. Updated API Configuration
File: `src/config/api.js`

Changed from:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5002/api';
```

To:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.27:5002/api';
```

## Test Login Now

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd L2L_EPR_BACK_V2
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should see: "Local URL: http://localhost:5002"

2. **Reload the mobile app:**
   - Shake device
   - Tap "Reload"
   
   Or restart:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Login with credentials:**
   - User ID: **ADMIN002**
   - Password: **Admin@123**

## Verify Backend Connection

Test in mobile browser first:
- Open browser on your phone
- Go to: `http://192.168.1.27:5002/health`
- Should see JSON response

If you see JSON, the connection works! ‚úÖ

## If Login Still Fails

### Check Backend Logs
Look at the backend terminal for errors when you try to login.

### Check Network
- Both devices on same WiFi
- Firewall not blocking port 5002

### Check Credentials
- User ID: ADMIN002 (case sensitive)
- Password: Admin@123 (case sensitive)

### Test Backend Directly
```bash
# From your computer
curl http://localhost:5002/api/auth/login \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"ADMIN002","password":"Admin@123"}'
```

Should return a token if credentials are correct.

## If Your IP Changes

If you connect to different WiFi, your IP might change.

Run this to find new IP:
```bash
./find-ip.sh
```

Then update `src/config/api.js` with the new IP.

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Backend running on port 5002  
‚úÖ Mobile app can reach backend  
‚úÖ Correct credentials entered  
‚úÖ Login should work!  

## After Successful Login

You should see:
1. Loading indicator
2. Navigation to Dashboard
3. Welcome message with your name
4. Bottom tabs (Home, Profile)

## Quick Test

1. Backend running? ‚úÖ
2. IP updated in api.js? ‚úÖ (192.168.1.27)
3. App reloaded? ‚è≥ (do this now)
4. Try login! üöÄ
