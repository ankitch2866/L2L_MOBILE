# Navigation Fixes - Payment & Cheque Management

## Issue
The Payment and Cheque Management modules were showing "Coming Soon" alerts even though they were fully implemented.

## Solution Applied

### 1. TransactionsScreen.js ✅
**Status:** Already Fixed (by autofix)

The TransactionsScreen already has the correct configuration:
```javascript
{ name: 'Payment', icon: 'credit-card', route: 'Payments', screen: 'PaymentsDashboard', implemented: true },
{ name: 'Cheque Management', icon: 'checkbook', route: 'Cheques', screen: 'ChequesDashboard', implemented: true },
```

Both modules are marked as `implemented: true` and have proper route/screen mappings.

### 2. PaymentsDashboardScreen.js ✅
**Enhancement:** Added Quick Access to Cheque Management

Added a new button in the Quick Actions section:
```javascript
<Button
  mode="outlined"
  icon="checkbook"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Cheques', { screen: 'ChequesDashboard' })}
  style={styles.actionButton}
>
  Cheque Management
</Button>
```

This allows users to quickly navigate from Payments to Cheques.

### 3. ChequesDashboardScreen.js ✅
**Enhancement:** Added Quick Access to Payment Management

Added a new button in the Quick Actions section:
```javascript
<Button
  mode="outlined"
  icon="credit-card"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Payments', { screen: 'PaymentsDashboard' })}
  style={styles.actionButton}
>
  Payment Management
</Button>
```

This allows users to quickly navigate from Cheques to Payments.

## Navigation Flow

### From Transactions Screen:
1. **Payment Module** → Navigates to `Payments` stack → `PaymentsDashboard` screen ✅
2. **Cheque Management Module** → Navigates to `Cheques` stack → `ChequesDashboard` screen ✅

### Cross-Module Navigation:
1. **From Payments Dashboard** → Quick access button to Cheque Management ✅
2. **From Cheques Dashboard** → Quick access button to Payment Management ✅

## Testing Checklist
