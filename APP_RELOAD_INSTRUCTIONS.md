# App Reload Instructions

## Issue: "Coming Soon" Still Showing After Implementation

If you're seeing a "Coming Soon" alert for a module that has been implemented (like Project Sizes), this is due to **React Native app caching**.

## Solution: Reload the App

### Method 1: Reload in Development Mode (Fastest)
1. **On iOS Simulator**: Press `Cmd + R`
2. **On Android Emulator**: Press `R` twice quickly
3. **On Physical Device**: Shake the device and select "Reload"

### Method 2: Clear Cache and Restart
```bash
# Navigate to the mobile app directory
cd L2L_EPR_MOBILE_FRONT_V2

# Clear Metro bundler cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# In a new terminal, run the app
npx react-native run-android
# OR
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Method 3: Full Clean Rebuild (If above methods don't work)

#### For Android:
```bash
cd L2L_EPR_MOBILE_FRONT_V2/android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

#### For iOS:
```bash
cd L2L_EPR_MOBILE_FRONT_V2/ios
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Method 4: Expo (If using Expo)
```bash
cd L2L_EPR_MOBILE_FRONT_V2
npx expo start -c
```

## Verification

After reloading, the Masters screen should show:

✅ **10 Master Modules** (all implemented):
1. Payment Plans
2. Projects
3. Properties
4. PLC
5. Stock
6. Brokers
7. Customers
8. Co-Applicants
9. Banks
10. **Project Sizes** ← Should work without "Coming Soon"

## What Was Fixed

The `MastersScreen.js` file has been correctly updated:

```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
{ name: 'Unit Sizes', icon: 'ruler', route: null, screen: null, implemented: false }

// AFTER (correct):
{ name: 'Project Sizes', icon: 'ruler', route: 'ProjectSizes', screen: 'ProjectSizesList', implemented: true }
```

## Current File Status

**File**: `src/screens/categories/MastersScreen.js`
- ✅ No "Unit Sizes" references
- ✅ "Project Sizes" properly configured
- ✅ All routes and screens mapped correctly
- ✅ `implemented: true` set correctly

## If Issue Persists

If you still see "Coming Soon" after trying all reload methods:

1. Check if you're running the correct app build
2. Verify you're not running an old APK/IPA file
3. Check if there are multiple instances of the app running
4. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app

## Quick Test

After reloading, tap on "Project Sizes" in the Masters screen. You should:
1. ✅ Navigate to the Project Sizes List screen
2. ✅ See a search bar and filter options
3. ✅ See a FAB (+) button to add new sizes
4. ✅ NO "Coming Soon" alert
