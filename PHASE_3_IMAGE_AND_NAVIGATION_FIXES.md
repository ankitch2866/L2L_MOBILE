# Phase 3: Image and Navigation Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Navigation Issue - Edit from View Screen
**Problem**: When editing a project from the ProjectDetailsScreen (View), after saving, the screen shows white/doesn't refresh with updated data.

**Root Cause**: 
- EditProjectScreen uses `navigation.goBack()` which returns to ProjectDetailsScreen
- ProjectDetailsScreen doesn't refresh data when it comes back into focus
- The data was only loaded in `useEffect` on mount, not on focus

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `useFocusEffect` hook to ProjectDetailsScreen to refresh data when screen comes into focus
- Added `fetchProjectById` call in EditProjectScreen before navigation to pre-load updated data
- This ensures the View screen always shows fresh data after editing

### 2. Image Display Issue
**Problem**: Images not displaying in the mobile app

**Backend Image Structure**:
- Backend stores full URLs in `sign_image_name` field
- Format: `http://192.168.1.27:5002/uploads/sign_images/filename.jpg`
- Images are served from `/uploads/sign_images/` directory

**Current Implementation**:
- ProjectDetailsScreen displays image using `sign_image_name` directly
- EditProjectScreen shows current image using `sign_image_name` directly
- AddProjectScreen has image picker but doesn't upload to backend yet

**Issues to Fix**:
1. Image upload not implemented (FormData needed)
2. Image display might fail if URL is invalid or server is unreachable
3. No error handling for failed image loads
4. No placeholder for missing images

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Navigation Refresh ✅
**File**: `ProjectDetailsScreen.js`
- Added `useFocusEffect` to reload project data when screen comes into focus
- Separated cleanup logic into separate `useEffect`

**File**: `EditProjectScreen.js`
- Added `fetchProjectById` call before navigation to pre-load updated data
- This ensures smooth transition back to View screen

### Fix 2: Image Display Enhancement ✅
**Files Updated**:
- `ProjectDetailsScreen.js` - Added error handling and placeholder
- `EditProjectScreen.js` - Added error handling
- Image section now always visible with graceful fallback

**Changes Made**:
- Added `onError` handler to log image load failures
- Added placeholder UI when no image is available
- Changed from conditional rendering to always showing image section
- Better UX with clear messaging

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix navigation refresh issue
2. ✅ Add image error handling and placeholders
3. ⏳ Implement actual image upload with FormData (TODO)
4. ✅ Test image display with real backend data
5. ⏳ Add image loading indicators (Optional)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Edit project from List screen - should return to List
- [x] Edit project from View screen - should return to View with updated data
- [x] View screen should show updated data immediately after edit
- [x] Images should display when available
- [x] Placeholder should show when image is missing
- [ ] Image upload should work in Add/Edit screens (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
- [x] Image removal should work properly (UI only, not backend)
