## API Endpoints Used

All endpoints are in the backend at `/api/master/`:

1. `GET /master/stock/stocklist` - Get all stocks with filters
2. `GET /master/stocks/:stock_id` - Get stock by ID
3. `POST /master/stocks` - Create new stock
4. `PUT /master/stocks/:stock_id` - Update stock
5. `DELETE /master/stocks/:stock_id` - Delete stock

## Data Flow

1. **Fetching Stocks**:
   - User opens Stock screen
   - Redux dispatches `fetchStocks` thunk
   - API returns stocks with related data (projects, units, brokers)
   - Data stored in Redux state
   - UI renders list with StockCard components

2. **Creating Stock**:
   - User fills form in AddStockScreen
   - Form validates required fields
   - Redux dispatches `createStock` thunk
   - Backend creates stock and updates unit status to 'hold'
   - Success alert shown, navigates back
   - List refreshes automatically

3. **Updating Stock**:
   - User navigates to EditStockScreen
   - Current stock data fetched and pre-populated
   - User modifies broker, hold date, or remarks
   - Redux dispatches `updateStock` thunk
   - Backend updates stock record
   - Success alert shown, navigates back

4. **Deleting Stock**:
   - User clicks delete on StockCard
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Redux dispatches `deleteStock` thunk
   - Backend deletes stock and updates unit status to 'free'
   - Success alert shown
   - List updates automatically

## Key Features

### Filtering
- Search by unit name, project name, or broker name
- Filter by project (dropdown with all projects)
- Clear filters button
- Real-time filtering on client side

### Validation
- Unit and broker are required
- Hold till date cannot be in the past
- Only 'free' units can be added to stock
- Unit cannot be added to stock twice

### Status Management
- Creating stock updates unit status to 'hold'
- Deleting stock updates unit status back to 'free'
- Status displayed with color-coded chips

### User Experience
- Pull-to-refresh on list screen
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Empty state with helpful message
- Success/error alerts for all operations
- Confirmation dialog for delete
- Smooth navigation flow

## Design Patterns

### Consistency
- Follows same patterns as Banks, PLC, and other modules
- Consistent header styling (red theme)
- Consistent form layouts
- Consistent card designs

### Code Organization
- Redux slice for state management
- Separate screens for each operation
- Reusable StockCard component
- Centralized navigation configuration

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Validation before API calls
- Graceful handling of network errors
