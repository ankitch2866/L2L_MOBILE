# Booking Module Fixes - January 10, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **fetchProperties is not a function Error**
**Problem**: The CreateBookingScreen was trying to import `fetchProperties` from propertiesSlice, but that function doesn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- Changed to use `fetchAllPropertiesData` which is the correct function in propertiesSlice
- Updated to use the properties state structure: `{ projects, projectUnits }`

### 2. **Missing Dropdown Component**
**Problem**: The CreateBookingScreen imported a Dropdown component from `../../../components/common` that didn't exist.

**Solution**:
- Created `src/components/common/Dropdown.js` - A reusable dropdown component using react-native-paper Menu
- Created `src/components/common/index.js` to export the component

### 3. **Incorrect API Endpoints**
**Problem**: The bookings slice was using `/transactions/bookings` but the backend uses `/transaction/bookings` (singular).

**Solution**: Updated all API endpoints in `bookingsSlice.js`:
- `/transactions/bookings` → `/transaction/bookings`
- `/transactions/bookings/:id` → `/transaction/bookings/:id`
- Updated error handling to check for both `error` and `message` fields

### 4. **Data Fetching Logic Not Matching Web Frontend**
**Problem**: The mobile app wasn't following the same data fetching pattern as the web frontend.

**Solution**: Updated CreateBookingScreen to match web frontend logic:
- Fetch customers by project with booking status: `/transaction/customers/project/:id/with-status`
- Filter only available customers (booking_status === 'available')
- Fetch brokers from `/master/brokers`
- Fetch payment plans from `/transaction/payment-query/payment-plans`
- Auto-select broker when customer is selected
- Filter only available units from the selected project

### 5. **Incorrect Payload Format**
**Problem**: The booking creation payload didn't match the backend API expectations.

**Solution**: Updated payload format to match web frontend:
```javascript
{
  customer_id: number,
  broker_id: number | null,
  booking_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  payment_plan_id: number,
  unit_id: number,
  unit_price: number,
  remarks: string
}
```

### 6. **Missing Form Fields**
**Problem**: The create booking form was missing important fields present in the web frontend.

**Solution**: Added missing fields:
- Project selection (required first)
- Broker selection (auto-filled from customer data)
- Payment plan selection (required)
- Cascading dropdowns: Project → Customer → Unit

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/common/Dropdown.js` - Reusable dropdown component
2. `src/components/common/index.js` - Component exports
3. `BOOKING_MODULE_FIXES.md` - This documentation

   - Fixed API endpoints (transactions → transaction)
   - Improved error handling

2. `src/screens/transactions/bookings/CreateBookingScreen.js`
   - Fixed imports (fetchProperties → fetchAllPropertiesData)
   - Added project selection
   - Added broker and payment plan fields

   - Added Alert for success/error messages

## How It Works Now

### Create Booking Flow:
1. User selects a **Project** (required)
2. System fetches customers for that project with booking status
3. User selects a **Customer** (only available customers shown)
4. System auto-fills broker if customer has one
5. User selects a **Unit** (only available units from selected project)
6. System auto-fills booking amount from unit price
7. User selects **Payment Plan** (required)
8. User can optionally change broker or add remarks
9. User submits the form

### Data Flow:
```
Project Selected
    ↓
Fetch Customers by Project (/transaction/customers/project/:id/with-status)
    ↓
Filter Available Customers (booking_status === 'available')
    ↓
Customer Selected
    ↓
Fetch Customer Details (/master/customers/edit/:id)
    ↓
Auto-fill Broker
    ↓
Unit Selected
    ↓
Auto-fill Booking Amount from Unit Price
    ↓
Submit Booking (/transaction/bookings)
```

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Test Create Booking**:
   - Select project
   - Verify customers are filtered by project
   - Verify only available customers shown
   - Select customer and verify broker auto-fills
   - Select unit and verify price auto-fills
   - Select payment plan
   - Submit and verify booking is created

2. **Test Edit Booking**:
   - Open existing booking
   - Modify fields
   - Submit and verify changes are saved

3. **Test List Booking**:
   - Verify bookings are displayed
   - Test search functionality
   - Test filter by status
   - Test pagination

4. **Test Delete Booking**:
   - Delete a booking
   - Verify confirmation dialog
   - Verify booking is removed

## API Endpoints Used

### Bookings:
- `GET /api/transaction/bookings` - List bookings
- `POST /api/transaction/bookings` - Create booking
- `GET /api/transaction/bookings/:id` - Get booking details
- `PUT /api/transaction/bookings/:id` - Update booking
- `DELETE /api/transaction/bookings/:id` - Delete booking
- `PATCH /api/transaction/bookings/:id/status` - Update status

### Supporting Data:
- `GET /api/master/projects` - Get all projects
- `GET /api/transaction/customers/project/:id/with-status` - Get customers by project with booking status
- `GET /api/master/customers/edit/:id` - Get customer details (for broker)
- `GET /api/master/project/:id/units` - Get units by project
- `GET /api/master/brokers` - Get all brokers
- `GET /api/transaction/payment-query/payment-plans` - Get payment plans

## Notes

- The mobile app now follows the exact same logic as the web frontend
- All data fetching patterns match the web implementation
- Payload formats are identical to ensure backend compatibility
- Customer filtering by booking status prevents double-booking
- Broker auto-selection improves user experience
- Unit price auto-fill reduces data entry errors
- Cascading dropdowns ensure data consistency

## Support

1. Check the web frontend implementation at `L2L_EPR_FRONT_V2/src/components/forms/transactions/booking/`
2. Verify API endpoints in the backend
3. Check browser network tab for API request/response format
4. Review this document for implementation details
