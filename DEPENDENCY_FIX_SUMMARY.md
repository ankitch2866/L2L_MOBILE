# Dependency Compatibility Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `@react-native-community/cli-server-api`
- **Problem**: Package was missing, causing Metro bundler to fail
- **Solution**: Installed as dev dependency
```bash
npm install --save-dev @react-native-community/cli-server-api
```

### 2. Version Mismatch - `@react-native-picker/picker`
- **Problem**: Version 2.11.2 installed, but Expo SDK 54 requires 2.11.1
- **Solution**: Downgraded to compatible version
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-picker/picker@2.11.1
```

### 3. Missing Navigation Dependencies
- **Problem**: Missing gesture handler and reanimated libraries
- **Solution**: Installed required packages
```bash
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

### 4. Deprecated expo-cli
- **Problem**: Global expo-cli is deprecated and causing warnings
- **Solution**: Removed from devDependencies (now using bundled CLI in expo package)
```bash
npm uninstall expo-cli
```

### 5. Missing babel.config.js
- **Problem**: No babel configuration file
- **Solution**: Created babel.config.js with proper presets and plugins

### 6. Missing Gesture Handler Import
- **Problem**: react-native-gesture-handler needs to be imported at app entry
- **Solution**: Added import at top of App.js

## Files Modified

## How to Start the App

Now you can start the app using:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Or use the shortcuts:
- `npx expo start --android` - Start on Android
- `npx expo start --ios` - Start on iOS
- `npx expo start --web` - Start on web

## Cache Cleanup

Cleared the following to ensure fresh start:
- `.expo` directory
- `node_modules/.cache`

## Next Steps

1. Start the development server: `npx expo start`
2. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your device
3. Or press `a` for Android emulator, `i` for iOS simulator

## Note

All dependencies are now compatible with Expo SDK 54. The app should start without errors.
