# Projects Module - Complete Fix ✅

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Project Not Loading Data
**Problem**: When clicking edit icon, form fields were empty instead of showing existing project data.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Fixed `fetchProjectById` to properly load project data
- ✅ Added `useEffect` to populate form when `currentProject` loads
- ✅ Added loading indicator while fetching data

### 2. View Project Showing Only 3 Fields

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Completely redesigned to match web frontend structure
- ✅ Added "Project Information" section with:
  - Project Name (with icon)
  - Company Name (with icon)
  - Created Date (with icon and formatting)
- ✅ Added "Location Details" section with:
  - Address (with icon)
  - Landmark (with icon, if available)
- ✅ Added header card with project avatar and name
- ✅ Added Edit button in header and bottom actions

### 3. Add Project Form Structure
**Problem**: Form didn't match web frontend structure with sections.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added "Project Information" section header
- ✅ Added "Location Details" section header
- ✅ Added dividers between sections
- ✅ Improved validation messages
- ✅ Added success alert on creation
