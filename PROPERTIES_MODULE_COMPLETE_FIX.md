# Properties Module - Complete Fix ✅

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Filter Button Freeze Issue
**Problem**: When filtering by project, the filter button would freeze and couldn't switch to another project.

**Root Cause**: 
- Menu wasn't closing properly after selection
- Missing proper handler function for project selection

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added dedicated `handleProjectSelect` function
- ✅ Ensures menu closes after selection: `setMenuVisible(false)`
- ✅ Properly dispatches Redux action to update selected project
- ✅ Added `contentStyle={{ maxHeight: 400 }}` to Menu for better scrolling

**Code Changes in `PropertiesListScreen.js`**:
```javascript
const handleProjectSelect = (projectId) => {
  dispatch(setSelectedProject(projectId));
  setMenuVisible(false);
};

// In Menu.Item:
onPress={() => handleProjectSelect(p.project_id.toString())}
```

### 2. Missing "All Projects" Option
**Problem**: Filter dropdown didn't have an "All Projects" option to clear the filter.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added "All Projects" menu item at the top of the filter dropdown
- ✅ Clicking it clears the filter by setting `selectedProject` to empty string
- ✅ Shows "All Projects" text when no filter is active

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
<Menu.Item 
  onPress={() => handleProjectSelect('')} 
  title="All Projects" 
  leadingIcon="home-city"
/>
```

### 3. Add Property Form Not Synced with Web Version
**Problem**: Mobile add property form was too simple - only had 4 fields, didn't match web version's comprehensive form.

**Web Version Has**:
- 3 sections: Project Selection, Unit Details, Additional Info
- Project dropdown
- Project sizes dropdown (dynamic based on selected project)
- Number of units to add
- Unit type dropdown
- Unit size dropdown
- BSP (price)
- Unit description dropdown

**Solution**: Completely rewrote `AddPropertyScreen.js` to match web version exactly.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integration
```javascript
// Fetches project sizes dynamically
const fetchProjectSizes = async (projectId) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`/api/master/project-sizes/project/${projectId}`);
  setProjectSizes(response.data.data || []);
};

// Creates units using correct endpoint
const response = await axios.post('/api/master/unit', {
  project_id: formData.project_id,
  count: Number(formData.count),
  unit_type: formData.unit_type,
  unit_size: parseFloat(formData.unit_size),
  bsp: parseFloat(formData.bsp),
  unit_desc: formData.unit_desc
});
```

### Form Validation
```javascript
✅ All required fields validated
✅ Number validation for count, size, and price
✅ Count must be 1-999
✅ Size and price must be positive numbers
✅ Clear error messages for each field
✅ Errors clear when user starts typing
```

### State Management
```javascript
✅ Separate menu visibility states for each dropdown
✅ Project sizes loaded dynamically when project changes
✅ Form resets unit_size when project changes
✅ Loading states for async operations
✅ Refreshes property list after successful creation
```
