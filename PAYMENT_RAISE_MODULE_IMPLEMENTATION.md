## Components Implemented

### 1. Redux Slice (Task 11.1) ✅
**File**: `src/store/slices/paymentRaisesSlice.js`

**Features**:
- Complete state management for payment raises
- Async thunks for all CRUD operations:
  - `fetchPaymentRaises` - Fetch all payment raises with filters

  - `fetchRaiseById` - Fetch single payment raise by ID
  - `updateRaise` - Update payment raise
  - `updateRaiseStatus` - Update payment raise status
  - `deleteRaise` - Delete payment raise
  - `fetchRaisesByProject` - Fetch raises by project
  - `fetchRaisesByCustomer` - Fetch raises by customer

**State Structure**:
```javascript
{
  list: [],
  current: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  filters: {
    search: '',
    project_id: null,
    customer_id: null,
    status: null,
    page: 1,
    limit: 20,
  }
}
```

**Reducers**:
- `setFilters` - Update filter values
- `clearFilters` - Reset all filters
- `clearCurrentRaise` - Clear current raise
- `clearError` - Clear error state

### 3. Navigation Integration ✅

- Consistent header styling with other modules

**Navigation Routes**:
- `PaymentRaisesList` - Main list screen

### 4. Redux Store Integration ✅

**File**: `src/store/index.js`

**Changes**:
- Imported `paymentRaisesReducer`
- Added `paymentRaises` to store configuration

## API Endpoints Used

Based on backend routes in `L2L_EPR_BACK_V2/src/routes/transactionRoutes.js`:

- `GET /transaction/raise-payment` - Fetch all payment raises
- `POST /transaction/raise-payment` - Create payment raise
- `GET /transaction/raise-payment/:id` - Fetch payment raise by ID
- `PUT /transaction/raise-payment/:id` - Update payment raise
- `PUT /transaction/raise-payment/:id/status` - Update status
- `DELETE /transaction/raise-payment/:id` - Delete payment raise
- `GET /transaction/raise-payment/projects/:projectId/queries` - Fetch payment queries for project
- `GET /master/projects` - Fetch projects
- `GET /master/customers/project/:projectId` - Fetch customers by project

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 7.1 ✅
- WHEN user navigates to Raise Payments THEN system SHALL display list of all raised payments

### Requirement 7.2 ✅
- WHEN user creates raise payment THEN system SHALL validate and create payment request

### Requirement 7.3 ✅
- WHEN user views raise payment THEN system SHALL display request details

### Requirement 7.4 ✅
- WHEN user edits raise payment THEN system SHALL update request data

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with createSlice and createAsyncThunk
2. **React Native Paper**: Consistent UI components
3. **Navigation**: React Navigation with stack navigators
4. **Error Handling**: Try-catch with user-friendly error messages
5. **Loading States**: Loading indicators and disabled states
6. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation before submission
7. **Refresh Control**: Pull-to-refresh functionality
8. **Empty States**: User-friendly empty state with actions

## Code Quality

- ✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- ✅ Consistent code style with existing modules
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Loading states implemented
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Responsive UI
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Redux slice reducers and actions
   - Form validation logic
   - Status color mapping

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - API calls with mock responses
   - Navigation flow
   - Redux state updates

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Create payment raise flow
   - Edit payment raise flow
   - Delete payment raise flow
   - Status update flow
   - Search and filter functionality

## Next Steps

The Payment Raise Module is now complete and ready for testing. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- Task 12: Unit Transfer Module
- Task 13: BBA Module
- Task 14: Dispatch Module
- Task 15: Customer Feedback Module

## Notes

- The module follows the same patterns as Payment Queries module for consistency
- Status management includes quick actions for approve/reject
- Payment query linking is optional but provides context when available
- All screens include proper loading states and error handling
- Navigation is integrated with the existing dashboard structure

## Files Created

1. `src/store/slices/paymentRaisesSlice.js`
2. `src/screens/transactions/paymentRaises/PaymentRaisesListScreen.js`
3. `src/screens/transactions/paymentRaises/CreatePaymentRaiseScreen.js`
4. `src/screens/transactions/paymentRaises/PaymentRaiseDetailsScreen.js`
5. `src/screens/transactions/paymentRaises/EditPaymentRaiseScreen.js`
6. `src/screens/transactions/paymentRaises/index.js`

## Files Modified

1. `src/store/index.js` - Added paymentRaises reducer
2. `src/navigation/DashboardNavigator.js` - Added PaymentRaisesStack and navigation routes
