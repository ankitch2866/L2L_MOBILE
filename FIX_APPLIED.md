# Fixes Applied to Phase 3 Implementation

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependency: @react-native-picker/picker
**Problem**: The Picker component was imported but the package wasn't installed.

**Solution**: 
- Installed `@react-native-picker/picker` package
- Updated `AddPropertyScreen.js` to use React Native Paper's Menu component as an alternative (more consistent with the app's design)

### 2. Missing Common Components
**Problem**: LoadingIndicator and EmptyState were imported from wrong path.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/components/index.js` to export existing components correctly
- Components now export from the correct paths:
  - `LoadingIndicator` from `./LoadingIndicator`
  - `EmptyState` from `./EmptyState`
  - `useToast` from `./Toast`

### 3. Component Exports
**Problem**: Components weren't properly exported from index files.

**Solution**:
- Created proper export structure in `src/components/index.js`
- All common components now accessible via single import
