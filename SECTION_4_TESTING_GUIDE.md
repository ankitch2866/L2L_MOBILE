## üîç Known Limitations

### API Endpoints
The following endpoints need to exist in the backend:
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats`
- `GET /api/dashboard/activities?limit=10`
- `GET /api/properties`

If these don't exist, you'll see error states.

### Navigation
Quick action buttons and property cards log to console instead of navigating because the destination screens don't exist yet. This is expected behavior.

### Mock Data
For testing without backend, you can modify the Redux slice to return mock data.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard doesn't load
- Check backend is running
- Verify API URL in `src/config/api.js`
- Check network connection
- Look for errors in console

### Statistics show 0
- Backend may not have data
- Check API response format
- Verify Redux state updates

### Images don't load
- Check image URLs are valid
- Verify network connection
- Check image format is supported

### Pull-to-refresh doesn't work
- Ensure ScrollView has RefreshControl
- Check refreshing state updates
- Verify async functions complete
