# Dashboard Fix Summary

## Problem
The mobile app dashboard was throwing "Not Found" errors and trying to fetch data from non-existent API endpoints.

## Root Cause
The mobile app was implementing features that don't exist in the web frontend:
- ❌ Statistics Cards (totalProperties, totalCustomers, etc.)
- ❌ Quick Actions Menu
- ❌ Recent Activities List
- ❌ Profile View Screen
- ❌ User Settings Screen
- ❌ Change Password Screen

## Web Frontend Analysis
The web frontend dashboard (`L2L_EPR_FRONT_V2/src/page/homepage/Dashboard.jsx`) only has:
1. ✅ Time-based greeting (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening)
2. ✅ Welcome message
3. ✅ Project/Unit selector (IdSection2)
4. ✅ Static property grid (no API calls)

The web frontend profile menu only has:
1. ✅ Reset Password (modal)
2. ✅ Logout

## Solution Applied

### Removed Unnecessary Features
1. **Deleted Profile Screens**
   - ❌ ProfileViewScreen.js
   - ❌ ChangePasswordScreen.js
   - ❌ UserSettingsScreen.js

2. **Deleted Dashboard Components**
   - ❌ StatisticsCards.js
   - ❌ QuickActionsMenu.js
   - ❌ RecentActivitiesList.js

3. **Removed Redux Dashboard Slice**
   - ❌ dashboardSlice.js (no longer needed)
   - Updated store configuration

### Simplified Dashboard
**DashboardHomeScreen.js** now only contains:
```javascript
- Time-based greeting
- Welcome message
- Static property grid
- Pull-to-refresh (just refreshes greeting)
```

### Simplified PropertyGridView
**PropertyGridView.js** now contains:
```javascript
- Static property categories (matches web frontend exactly)
- Three categories:
  1. THE RISE OF LIFESTYLE
  2. CITY LIVING
  3. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
- No API calls
- Placeholder images
```

## Files Modified

### Updated Files
1. `src/screens/dashboard/DashboardHomeScreen.js` - Simplified to match web
2. `src/screens/dashboard/PropertyGridView.js` - Static data only
3. `src/store/index.js` - Removed dashboard reducer

### Deleted Files
1. `src/screens/dashboard/StatisticsCards.js`
2. `src/screens/dashboard/QuickActionsMenu.js`
3. `src/screens/dashboard/RecentActivitiesList.js`
4. `src/screens/profile/ProfileViewScreen.js`
5. `src/screens/profile/ChangePasswordScreen.js`
6. `src/screens/profile/UserSettingsScreen.js`
7. `src/store/slices/dashboardSlice.js`

## Result

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. No more "Not Found" API errors
2. Dashboard loads instantly (no API calls)
3. Matches web frontend functionality exactly
4. Clean, simple implementation

### Current Dashboard Features
- ✅ Time-based greeting
- ✅ Welcome message
- ✅ Static property grid with 3 categories
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh
- ✅ No API dependencies
- ✅ No errors

### What's NOT Included (Because Web Doesn't Have It)
- ❌ Statistics cards
- ❌ Quick actions menu
- ❌ Recent activities
- ❌ Profile view screen
- ❌ User settings screen
- ❌ Change password screen

## Next Steps

If you want to add these features in the future, you'll need to:
1. Create the backend API endpoints first
2. Implement them in the web frontend
3. Then add them to the mobile app

For now, the mobile app matches the web frontend exactly.
