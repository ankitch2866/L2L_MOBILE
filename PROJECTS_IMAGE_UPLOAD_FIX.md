  aspect: [4, 3],
  quality: 0.8,
}
```

### Permissions Handling
- ✅ Requests media library permissions
- ✅ Shows alert if permission denied
- ✅ Graceful error handling

### List Refresh Logic
```javascript
// After create/update
await dispatch(createProject(dataToSend)).unwrap();
await dispatch(fetchProjects()).unwrap(); // ← Refresh list
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Image Upload Implementation
Currently, the image picker is implemented but the actual upload to the server requires:
1. FormData creation
2. Multipart/form-data content type
3. Backend API support for file upload

**TODO**: Implement full image upload with FormData when backend is ready.

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ User can select image
- ✅ Image preview works
- ⚠️ Image is not sent to server yet (needs FormData implementation)

### Future Enhancement
```javascript
// Example of how to implement full upload:
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('project_name', data.project_name);
formData.append('company_name', data.company_name);
formData.append('address', data.address);
formData.append('landmark', data.landmark);

if (signImage) {
  formData.append('sign_image', {
    uri: signImage.uri,
    type: 'image/jpeg',
    name: 'sign_image.jpg',
  });
}

// Send with multipart/form-data
```
