## API Endpoints Required

The following backend endpoints need to be implemented:

```
GET    /api/transactions/bookings              - Fetch all bookings
POST   /api/transactions/bookings              - Create new booking
GET    /api/transactions/bookings/:id          - Fetch booking by ID
PUT    /api/transactions/bookings/:id          - Update booking
DELETE /api/transactions/bookings/:id          - Delete booking
PATCH  /api/transactions/bookings/:id/status   - Update booking status
```

## Backend Business Logic Requirements

### Critical Backend Implementations Needed:
1. **Property Status Management**
   - Update property status to "Booked" when booking is confirmed
   - Release property to "Available" when booking is cancelled
   - Prevent double-booking of properties

2. **Customer Validation**
   - Verify customer exists and is active
   - Check customer eligibility for booking

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Use database transactions for booking + property updates
   - Ensure data consistency
   - Rollback on errors

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all booking operations
   - Track status changes
   - Record user actions

5. **Notifications**
   - Send confirmation emails/SMS to customers
   - Notify sales team of new bookings
   - Alert on cancellations

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create booking with valid data
- [ ] Create booking with invalid data (should show errors)

- ✅ Documentation complete

## Notes

- The booking module is fully implemented on the frontend
- Backend API endpoints need to be created
- Business logic for property status updates must be implemented on backend
- All client-side validations are in place
- The module follows the same patterns as existing modules (Customers, Projects, Properties)
- Ready for backend integration and testing
