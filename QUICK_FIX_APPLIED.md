# Quick Fix Applied - Navigation Issue

## Problem
The app was crashing with error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined."

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. Missing ErrorBoundary Export ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** `ErrorBoundary` was not exported in `src/components/index.js`
**Fix:** Added export for ErrorBoundary component

### 2. Too Many Bottom Tabs (Temporary Fix) ✅ APPLIED
**Issue:** 7 tabs in bottom navigation was causing layout issues
**Fix:** Temporarily removed Co-Applicants and Brokers from bottom tabs

## Current Status

### Bottom Navigation (5 tabs - Working)
1. ✅ Home
2. ✅ Projects
3. ✅ Properties
4. ✅ Customers
5. ✅ Profile

### Modules Available (But Not in Bottom Nav)
- Co-Applicants (fully built, needs alternative access)
- Brokers (fully built, needs alternative access)

## Next Steps to Access Co-Applicants & Brokers

### Option 1: Add to Dashboard Home Screen
Add quick action buttons on the Dashboard to navigate to:
- Co-Applicants List
- Brokers List

### Option 2: Create Masters Menu
Create a "Masters" tab that shows a menu with:
- Projects
- Properties
- Customers
- Co-Applicants
- Brokers
- (Future: Payment Plans, PLC, etc.)

### Option 3: Drawer Navigation
Implement a drawer menu accessible from the header that includes all modules

## Recommended Solution

**Add Quick Actions to Dashboard** - This is the fastest fix:

```javascript
// In DashboardHomeScreen.js, add navigation buttons:
<QuickActionButton
  title="Co-Applicants"
  icon="account-multiple"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('CoApplicantsList')}
/>
<QuickActionButton
  title="Brokers"
  icon="account-tie"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('BrokersList')}
/>
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/index.js` - Added ErrorBoundary export
2. `src/navigation/DashboardNavigator.js` - Temporarily removed 2 tabs

## To Restore Full Navigation

Once we implement one of the options above, we can either:
1. Keep the 5-tab layout and access other modules through dashboard
2. Implement a drawer navigation for all modules
3. Create a "More" tab that shows a menu of additional modules

---

**Status:** App should now load successfully with 5 tabs
**Action Required:** Choose how to provide access to Co-Applicants and Brokers modules
