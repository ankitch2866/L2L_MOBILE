## Implementation Date
January 10, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. Redux Slice
**File**: `src/store/slices/dispatchesSlice.js`

**Features**:
- Complete state management for dispatches
- Async thunks for all CRUD operations:

  - `fetchDispatchesByProject` - Get dispatches by project
  - `fetchDispatchesByCustomer` - Get dispatches by customer
- Filters support for customer type, letter type, and project
- Error handling and loading states

**State Structure**:
```javascript
{
  list: [],
  current: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,

- Item details: name, description, quantity
- Save items to dispatch
- Empty state with call-to-action

### 4. Navigation Integration

**Updated Files**:
- `src/navigation/DashboardNavigator.js`
- `src/screens/categories/TransactionsScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Added DispatchStack navigator with all dispatch screens
- Integrated into main navigation flow
- Added "Dispatch" button in Transactions category screen
- Proper header styling and back button functionality

### 5. Store Integration

**Updated File**: `src/store/index.js`

**Changes**:
- Added `dispatchesReducer` to Redux store
- Properly configured with other reducers

## API Endpoints Used

Based on backend implementation:
- `GET /transaction/dispatches` - List all dispatches
- `POST /transaction/dispatches` - Create dispatch
- `GET /transaction/dispatches/:id` - Get dispatch by ID
- `PUT /transaction/dispatches/:id` - Update dispatch
- `DELETE /transaction/dispatches/:dispatch_id` - Delete dispatch
- `GET /transaction/projects/:project_id/dispatches` - Get by project
- `GET /transaction/customer-dispatches?customer_id=:id` - Get by customer

## Data Model

### Dispatch Object Structure
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  letterType: string,
  customer_id: number,
  customer_name: string,
  customerType: 'INDIVIDUAL' | 'COMPANY' | 'PARTNERSHIP' | 'PROPRIETORSHIP',
  dispatchDate: date,
  location: string,
  unitNo: string,
  unit_name: string,
  project_name: string,
  modeOfLetterSending: 'BY_HAND' | 'BY_COURIER' | 'BY_POST',
  consignmentNo: string,
  courierCompany: string,
  remarks: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 10.1**: List all dispatches with filtering
✅ **Requirement 10.2**: Create new dispatch with validation
✅ **Requirement 10.3**: View complete dispatch details
✅ **Requirement 10.4**: Edit existing dispatch
✅ **Requirement 10.5**: Track dispatch items (screen created for future use)

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with createSlice and createAsyncThunk
2. **Component Composition**: Reusable DispatchCard component
3. **Consistent Navigation**: Follows existing app navigation patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with user-friendly messages
5. **Loading States**: Loading indicators during async operations
6. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation before submission
7. **Conditional Rendering**: Shows/hides fields based on context
8. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper spacing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Redux slice reducers and actions
   - Form validation logic
   - Date formatting utilities

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - API calls with mock responses
   - Navigation flow between screens
   - Redux state updates

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - Create dispatch flow
   - Edit dispatch flow
   - Delete dispatch flow
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Pagination

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dispatch Items**: Fully implement the items tracking feature
2. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk dispatch creation
3. **Export**: Export dispatch list to PDF/Excel
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications for dispatch status
5. **Tracking**: Real-time tracking for courier dispatches
6. **Analytics**: Dispatch statistics and reports
7. **Filters**: Additional filters (date range, project, status)
8. **Sorting**: Sort by date, customer, type, etc.

## Known Limitations

1. Dispatch items feature is scaffolded but not fully integrated with backend
2. No date picker component (uses text input for dates)
3. No image/document attachment support
4. No dispatch status workflow (pending, in-transit, delivered)

## Dependencies

- React Native
- React Navigation
- Redux Toolkit
- React Native Paper (UI components)
- date-fns (date formatting)
- react-native-vector-icons (icons)
